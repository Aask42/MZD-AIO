He went on to develop a CMD based program to accomplish this and it worked well but had reached certain limitations and lacked that modern app feel.  I contacted Siutsch and proposed we make the next AIO desktop app style starting with the same tweaks from AIO v1.5.x that we all know and love. I went on to develop MZD-AIO-TI. \n\n##### I personallty tested all the tweaks in my 2016 Mazda3 FW:55.00.753A-NA\n\nCurrently this app is in a BETA TEST phase in its final stages of development.  I ask for 2 things from anyone who participates in testing this app before its official release: \n\n1. Give some feedback and report any bugs or major issues.  \n\n2. Be cautious and mindful to what you are doing to your system while installing or unistalling tweaks.  I can offer no warranty but I did include every safety precaution I know about.\n\n###### **So please, be mindful when preforming tweak installs.**  \n\nThis app will automatically update.","t2":"","msg2":""},{"id":1,"title":"Tweaking","msg":"<h3> All changes happen at your own risk! </h3>\n <b>Please understand that you can damage or brick your infotainment system running these tweaks! </b>\n Anyone who is unsure should leave it alone, ask someone with experience to help or ask in the <a href='' onclick=externalLink('mazda3revolution')>forum</a>.<h5> I am not responsible for damages that may incur from the use.</h5>Having said that, MZD-AIO-TI was built with Safety in mind so there are 3 compatibility levels: \n\n - <span class='hlpsfty twk-safe'>All</span> - Compatible with all known firmware versions \n - <span class='hlpsfty twk-warn'>Under58</span> - Only compatible with firmware versions less then 58 (ie. 55 & 56).

AIO also contains an original version of each file just in case any of the backup files are missing. In future versions I plan to include an option to copy and store your own system's backup files into AIO as a failsafe to ensure compatability for future CMD versions.\n - In general, for all Compatible CMD versions it is safe to run uninstalls of tweaks that have not been installed BUT keep in mind that AIO will overwrite the files involved with the included failsafe backups because it will not find any available backups in the system.
