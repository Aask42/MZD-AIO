<h2>CASDK</h2>

<p>
  <div class="w3-container">
    <div class="header">CASDK is a micro framework that allows developers to write and deploy custom applications which integrate natively into the existing JCI framework without hassle. CASDK simplifies the app development process with a straight-forward, and slimmed down
      but powerful API. This version is integrated to run AIO apps alongside CASDK apps with no conflicts and imperceptible performance impact. Together they create a unique framework leading developers to a new realm of customization and application possibilities.</div>
    <h5>CASDK Comes With:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>CASDK Proxy</b> - Proxy registers both CASDK and AIO apps.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Custom Application Runtime</b> - A microframework that handles the custom applications during runtime. </li>
      <li>
        <b>Data Readers</b> - Poll vehicle data an certain intervals (1s, 60s, &amp; 300s) </li>
      <li>
        <b>JS logging</b> - JavaScript (and CSS) console log is written to /tmp/root/casdk-error.log </li>
      <li>
        <b>LocalStorage</b> - Moves the save location of localStorage to /tmp/mnt/data_persist/storage/ </li>
      <li>
        <b>NodeJS</b> - Powerful Server-side JavaScript.</li>
      <li>
        <b>ADB</b> - Android Debug Bridge for Android devices.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Custom Applications</b> - Apps that run on the CASDK framework</li>
    </ul>
    <b>AIO + CASDK Framework and Apps are installed internally to the &#39;resources&#39; partition by default. Optionally, CASDK apps can be installed onto an SD Card. </b>
    <div> Native apps installed with AIO (Speedometer, Video Player, AA, etc.) will run on the CASDK framework although apps need to be installed differently with CASDK. The AIO Tweak installer will detect if CASDK is installed when running tweaks and adjust the installation accordingly
      but older app installers may not install apps correctly while CASDK is installed.</div>
    <div>CASDK apps have very little impact on system performance, I encourage all developers to create one. Using the SD Card app method allows you to run any CASDK app even one you create yourself!</div>
    <div>Although I did not create most of the CASDK apps included with AIO, I did make numerous enhancements and/or bug fixes in every single one including CASDK the framework itself.  Please report CASDK bugs in the <a href="" onclick="externalLink('issues')">MZD-AIO Github Repository Issues Section</a>.</div>
  </div>
</p>

<h4>Android Auto Headunit App v1.09 w/ Wifi Support</h4>

<li><b>The headunit process will automatically restart if it crashes.</b></li>
<p>Instructions For Android Auto WiFi: <li>0. Before you start: Activate Android Auto developer mode by going to about and tapping the title bar until it says you are a developer </li><li>1. From Android Phone: Create Hotspot</li> <li>2. From Vehicle: Turn on Wifi, connect to
  phone hotspot</li> <li>3. Phone: In Android Auto app go to about screen menu and start headunit server </li><li>4. Android Auto will start automatically, if it does not or you get a black screen you can open Android Auto from the applications menu.</li></p>

<h4>VideoPlayer v3.5</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Fullscreen button toggles: Boxed - Keep Aspect Ratio - Fullscreen</li>
  <li>Repeat is one button toggles: none - 1 - all</li>
  <li>StatusBarNotifications for toggles</li>
  <li>Video title will filter out the extension and turn underscores to spaces</li>
  <li>Shows gplay error in error message</li>
  <li>After hitting an error will make up to 3 attempts to re-start the video in 10 second intervals</li>
  <li>Video Resumes where it left off when shifting out of reverse</li>
  <li>Added to option "Resume Play" - when checked:
    <ul>
      <li>Resumes the video where you left off if it was interrupted or the app was exited while playing.</li>
      <li>Saves video list to reopen and resume quickly (reloads if switch to music or press reload button)</li>
      <li>If the video is stopped and you are in the list view when you exit you will return to the list when reopened.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;Black Out Background&quot; option - Will overlay all other GUI layers leaving only the video and solid black background
    <ul>
      <li>If &quot;Title to Statusbar&quot; is checked, Video Title will show centered above video and time in the bottom left corner (but can be toggled with the multicontroller).</li>
      <li>This is ON TOP of all layers including the statusbar and bottom controls while the video player background is ON THE BOTTOM of all the other layers</li>
      <li>Pausing the video temporarily hides the overlay</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In VideoPlayer Info panel (tab next to options) will show swap memory data and &quot;unmount swap&quot; button (if swapfile is present) - Makes an attempt to unmount swapfile on shutdown to avoid freezing. NOTES ON SWAPFILE: When using the swapfile
    it is recommended to use the &quot;unmount swap&quot; button before turning off and shutting down the system. If a significant amount of memory is &quot;swapped&quot; then the shutdown sequence is not enough time for the swapfile to fully unmount
    and the system will freeze. In the list view long hold down to check how much memory is in the swap cache, manually unmounting a few seconds before system shutdown solves the freezing issue.</li>
  <li>Added Multicontroller &#39;hold&#39; actions
    <ul>
      <li>While media is playing:
        <ul>
          <li>Up - Toggle Title</li>
