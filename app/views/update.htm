<h3>2.7.0</h3>

<h6>The software distribution service bintray.com has cancelled my account because they had recently seen the DMCA Takedown notice in the MZD-AIO-TI GitHub repository from March 6th, 2017.  Although I explained that the NNG files had been removed immediately upon receiving the notice, they only agreed to leave the versions that had already been uploaded (Ending with v2.6.8) but would block my account from uploading any future versions. Therefor Automatic updates may or may not work in this version until I find another reliable distribution solution.  So in case new updates do not download automatically &quot;Check For Update&quot; has been added in the top menu bar under the &quot;Download&quot; menu.</h6>

<h5>Android Auto v1.04</h5>

<ul><li><strong><em>Bluetooth Call Bug Fixed!!!</em></strong> <em>Big thanks to @lmagder for fixing the headunit code after the &#39;Bluetooth call patch&#39; clarified the root of the issue</em></li><li>Video focus is lost at the beginning and end of a call due to the system expecting a context change.  <b>Press the FAV (<span class="icon-star"></span>) Button to get video focus back and AA will function normally.</b></li><li>Phone button opens AA phone screen, also call buttons work for answering and ending calls.</li><li>NAV button opens the AA home screen</li><li>Tap the black box on the credit screen to display contents of the headunit.log file.</li><li>Added the Android Auto Icon to the statusbar</li><li>(The &#39;Bluetooth Call Patch&#39; from AA 1.03 is no longer needed from this version on.)<ul><li>(If it was applied will be reverted back to normal)</li></ul></li></ul>
<h6><b>NOTES ON AA BLACK SCREEN ISSUE:</b> When starting AA you will sometimes get a black screen.  This is due to a memory error (The same error encountered in the VideoPlayer app).  There are a few ways to attempt to fix this issue:</h6><ol><li>Put the vehicle in and out of reverse <B>ONLY IF THE VEHICLE IS AT A COMPLETE STOP, I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH</B></li><li>Open the VideoPlayer App and play a video.  You will hit a memory error on the first video you choose, but pressing 'next track' will sometimes cause gstreamer to reset and reallocate the needed memory space.  I found this out by luck.</li><li>Reboot the system and your phone. If you tried the other 2 options and they didnt work rebooting will almost always fix the issue.</li></ol>
<h5>VideoPlayer v3.0</h5>

<ul><li>Gave the VideoPlayer its own Icon</li><li>Toggle Unicode Mode On/Off with &quot;U&quot; Icon (If you have a lot of videos you will see the difference in load time)</li><li>Information/Options Panel, Open/Close with &quot;i&quot; Icon</li>
<ul><li>Close by pressing command knob</li><li>Option: Hide/Show Unicode button</li><li>Video Title to Statusbar</li><li>Test Error Message</li><ul><li>I put this in for me to test the error message because all my videos are formatted <strong>360p MP4 H264 AAC</strong> so I rarely hit a memory error.</li></ul></ul>
<li>Select options with left/right now includes reboot, show/hide background and info/options button.</li><li>Memory Error Message is now very informative</li><ul><li>Offers Suggestions to Avoid Future Errors</li><li>Often pressing 'next track' will clear the error and play the next video</li></ul><li>Changed highlight color to blue</li></ul>
