  <p>Fully tested & bug fixes for FW v70.00.021.</p>
  <p>As the FW versions progress past v70.00.021+ with Android Auto and Car Play coming standard we have come to a point where only a little bit of hard drive space remains to install tweaks and it has become a known issue.  Most tweaks only make extremely small changes but the real side effect of running out of space while installing tweaks is that creation of backup files will fail if there is insufficient space to create them.  The installer is now aware of this and when the scenerio is detected, it will abort the installation and attempt to mitigate the issue but be extremely careful if you have installed tweaks on v70.00.021+ with a previous version of AIO.  Also, please take note that installing only a few tweaks at a time is recomended on later FW versions to aviod this and similar issues.
