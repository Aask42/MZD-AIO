  <h2>I am proud to present an extremely exciting AIO update!</h2>
  <h2>It is finally here!
    <b>AIO + CASDK!</b>
  </h2>
</center>
<h5>CASDK is a micro framework developed by @flyandi that allows developers to easily write and deploy custom applications which integrate natively into the existing JCI framework without hassle. Now fully integrated with AIO apps, CASDK framework will run
  them without conflict! CASDK apps are unlockable through codes released on <a onclick="externalLink('casdk')">mazdatweaks.com CASDK page.</a></h6>
  <p>
    <center>
      <h6>NEW STUFF:
        <b>Android Auto WiFi Support</b>, Video Player App v2.5, many tweak files optimized, and a reworked "app list" patch for v59+</h6>NOTE:
      <b>When installing apps on v59+ with AIO v2.8 for the first time only</b>, "No More Disclaimer" and "Order of Audio Source List" tweaks will need to be reinstalled because of the new patch. Those tweaks have also been fixed for v59.00.545+.</center>
  </p>
  <p>Also, Experimental support for FW v70.00.000+. (Only tested on v70.00.000 if using newer FW version use extreme caution)</p>
