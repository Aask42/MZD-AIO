Hello everyone, your favorite hacker Trezdog44 here to say thank you for enjoying AIO. I am proud to say over 100,000 people all around the world have modified their infotainment systems with AIO.  For those of you who can read and understand english, only about 20% of people even read these little intro blurbs I include with each version. If you made it this far then thats perfect, you are in my target audience so I will tell you a little about myself.  My name is Trevor, I live in Southern California, and I am head of IT and development at ScreenBid, a quickly growing company that sells TV show and Movie props at online auctions and soon in a retail store located in the heart of Hollywood.  I spend a good amount of my free time working on things related to AIO and recently on Android Auto which I only get 2 chances to test a day while I am driving down the 110 freeway to and from work and if you don't know anything about So. Cal let me tell you, the 110 is a treacherous drive. <br>
<br> The bane of this project has always been the Android Auto 'Bluetooth Call Bug' that had been driving me crazy for over 8 months. Nonetheless I finally found a way to make bluetooth calls work with Android Auto installed by patching a system sound configuration file.  Then one of the major contributors to the AA project on GitHub @lmagder took my findings and fixed the headunit code to handle the sound properly which I couldn't do because I have never programmed anything before in C++ (and trust me when I say I tried EXTREMELY HARD to fix the code itself which eventually led me to the root of the issue and in the process I learned a good a amount of C++).  So now the time has come, you can make and receive Bluetooth calls using your car speakers with AA installed but there is one remaining issue that I made a reasonable fix for, when making or receiving a call you lose video focus but not control focus.  So pressing the FAV (<span class="icon-star"></span>) button will give you back video focus and the app will function normally.
<br><br><b>So to every single one of you HUNDREDS of people who e-mailed me asking when I was going to fix this issue, <div style="font-size:26px;font-weight:900px;">You're Welcome.</b> <p>~Trezdog44</p></div>
